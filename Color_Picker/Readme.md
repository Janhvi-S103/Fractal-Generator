# Unity Color Picker with Gradients

Creating a color picker with gradients and highlighting the selected color is a bit more complex, but it's certainly doable. In this Unity project, we'll create a color picker with these features.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the color picker in your Unity project:

### Prerequisites

- Unity (any version)
- A gradient texture (can be created in an image editing tool or procedurally generated)

### Installation

1. **Create a new Unity project or open an existing one.**

2. **Create a UI Canvas for the color picker:**
   - In the Hierarchy panel, right-click, and select UI > Canvas. This will create a canvas for your UI elements.

3. **Create a Panel for the gradient:**
   - Inside the Canvas, right-click, and select UI > Panel.
   - This panel will be used to display the color gradient.

4. **Create a RawImage for the gradient texture:**
   - Inside the Panel, right-click, and select UI > Raw Image.
   - Attach a gradient texture to this RawImage. You can create a gradient texture in an image editing tool like Photoshop or use a procedural gradient generation method.

5. **Create a UI Slider for selecting the color:**
   - Inside the Canvas, right-click, and select UI > Slider.
   - This slider will be used to pick the color from the gradient.

6. **Create a UI Image for displaying the selected color:**
   - Inside the Canvas, right-click, and select UI > Image.
   - This image will display the currently selected color.

7. **Create a C# script for the color picker:**
   - Right-click in the Assets panel and select Create > C# Script.
   - Name the script "ColorPicker" and double-click to open it in your code editor.

8. **Implement the ColorPicker script:**

   ```csharp
   // Paste the ColorPicker script code here
   ```

9. **Attach the ColorPicker script to an empty GameObject:**
   - Create an empty GameObject in your Hierarchy panel.
   - Select the empty GameObject and drag the "ColorPicker" script onto it.

10. **Assign the UI elements to the script:**
    - In the Inspector, drag and drop the Gradient RawImage, Slider, and Selected Color Image into the corresponding fields of the ColorPicker script (gradientImage, colorSlider, selectedColorImage).

11. **Load or generate the gradient texture:**
    - Make sure to load or generate a gradient texture and assign it to the `gradientImage` in the `Start` method of the script. Replace `"GradientTexture"` with the actual name of your gradient texture.

12. **Test the color picker:**
    - Play your Unity scene, and you should be able to select colors by adjusting the slider. The selected color will be displayed in the selected color image, and the gradient texture will show the available color choices.

Make sure you have a gradient texture with the desired colors for the color picker, and don't forget to adjust the texture's size to match the RawImage size.
